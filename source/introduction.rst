Welcome to our session. What follows are our essential teaching goals. The high
level take away.


Layers of Abstraction
=====================

In a sense all a computer can do is store 0s and 1s, move them around, and add.

Yet the computers of today (software and hardware) are incredibly complex.

This complexity is managed by using layers of abstraction.

We will see how you can use computers creatively by
designing and implementing layers of abstraction over simple components to
build ever more complex and useful building blocks.


General Purpose Computing
=========================

As we will see a Raspberry Pi is nothing more nor less than just another
computer. Its components are similar to those you will find in any modern
device (phone, tablet, laptop, desktop...).

This course will demystfy the various computers out there.

All the concepts taught can be translated to other devices and operating
systems.


Tinkering
=========

As mentioned, all concepts are transferrable to other environemnt. Android,
iOs, Windows, Mac OSX, and the various Linuxes.

What sets the Raspberry Pi apart is that it hides little and deliberately tries
to get you to play.

The intention is to encourage you to tinker in a safe environemnt that exposes
far more of the innner workings than the more protected mainstream experiences
that other devices provide.

You can't break anything that can't be fixed! If you do break something,
congratulations you have done something cretive and it is a leaning opportunity
awaits.
